# Project-5-6
Design a program to manage the undergraduate and graduate student information. It includes following functions. Note: UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE students are different. For Undergraduate student, they have information SSN, Name, Age, Major, HighSchool, Unit, and Fee ($600/per unit). For graduate student, they have information SSN, Name, Age, Major, BSCollege, Unit, and Fee ($700/per unit). 
 
(1) Print out all the current student information, including the SSN, Name, Age, Major and other information. (2) Add a student (3) Delete a student according to the student’s SSN (4) Modify a student’s information who is specified by his SSN. (5) Quit 
 
Hints: 
 
(1) Step 1: Construct a supclass Student  
 
(2) Step 2: Construct two subclasses Undergraduate_Student and Graduate_Student. 
 
(3) Step 3: Construct a class StudentList to include an array of students. 
 
(4) Step 4: Distinguish Undergraduate_Student and Graduate_Student when you calculus the fee and print out the student information 
 
(5) Step 5: Design another public class to include the “main” method. In the main method, list all the functions; the user can input the function number, such as: 1. Print out the current student list 2. Add a student 3. Delete a student 4. Modify a student 5. Quit 
 
 
 

 
Project 6 
 
Continue to add the functions into the Project 5. Following new functions should be added into the Project 5. 
 
(1) The user can input a student information in one line. 
 
(2) Print out all the current student information sorted by SSN, Name, or Age according to the user’s selection. 
 
(3) Delete a student according to the student’s SSN, or Name according to the user’s selection. 
 
(4) Modify a student’s information who is specified by his SSN or Name according to the user’s selection. 
 
(5) Quit 
 
Hints: 
 
1. Be careful string comparison 
 
2. In order to input more information in one line, you have to use the StringTokenizer class or String split method.
